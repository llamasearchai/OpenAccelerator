**Project**: OpenAccelerator - Enterprise-Grade Publication Setup

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for publishing the OpenAccelerator project to GitHub and PyPI with professional presentation that will impress recruiters from GitHub, OpenAI, and xAI.

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account (preferably with a professional profile)
- PyPI account for package publication
- Git configured with your credentials
- All project files completed and committed

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### 1.1 Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `OpenAccelerator`
3. Description: `Enterprise-Grade Systolic Array Computing Framework with AI Agents and Medical Compliance`
4. Set to **Public** for maximum visibility
5. Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we have these already)
6. Click "Create repository"

### 1.2 Configure Local Repository

```bash
# Add GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenAccelerator.git

# Verify remote
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Configure GitHub Repository Settings

### 2.1 Repository Settings

1. Go to repository Settings
2. Under "General":
   - Add website URL: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/OpenAccelerator`
   - Add topics: `machine-learning`, `accelerator`, `medical-ai`, `fastapi`, `docker`, `openai`, `hipaa`, `fda-validation`
   - Enable "Sponsorships" if desired

### 2.2 Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Source: "Deploy from a branch"
3. Branch: `main`
4. Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click "Save"

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy documentation.

### 2.3 Enable Discussions and Issues

1. Go to Settings → General
2. Enable "Issues"
3. Enable "Discussions"
4. Add issue templates if desired

## Step 3: Professional Repository Enhancement

### 3.1 Create Professional Profile

Ensure your GitHub profile includes:
- Professional profile picture
- Complete bio mentioning your expertise
- LinkedIn and email contact information
- Pinned repositories including OpenAccelerator

### 3.2 Repository Shields and Badges

The README.md already includes professional badges:
- License badge
- Python version badge
- Tests passing badge
- Coverage badge
- Code style badge

### 3.3 Release Management

Create your first release:

```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0: Production-ready enterprise-grade framework"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Go to GitHub → Releases → "Create a new release":
- Tag: `v1.0.0`
- Title: `OpenAccelerator v1.0.0 - Production Release`
- Description: Include comprehensive release notes highlighting key features

## Step 4: PyPI Publication

### 4.1 Prepare for PyPI

Install publication tools:
```bash
pip install build twine
```

### 4.2 Build Package

```bash
# Clean previous builds
rm -rf dist/ build/

# Build package
python -m build

# Verify package
twine check dist/*
```

### 4.3 Upload to PyPI

```bash
# Upload to Test PyPI first (recommended)
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

# Test installation from Test PyPI
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ open-accelerator

# Upload to production PyPI
twine upload dist/*
```

## Step 5: Documentation Deployment

### 5.1 Verify GitHub Pages

1. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete
2. Check https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/OpenAccelerator
3. Verify all documentation loads correctly

### 5.2 Update Documentation Links

Ensure all links in README.md and documentation point to the correct URLs:
- GitHub repository: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OpenAccelerator`
- Documentation: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/OpenAccelerator`
- PyPI package: `https://pypi.org/project/open-accelerator`

##  **Automated Publication Process**

The publication process is **fully automated** by the `tag-release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

### **How It Works**

1. **Trigger**: A push to the `main` branch with a commit message containing `[RELEASE]` triggers the workflow.
2. **Versioning**: The workflow automatically determines the next version number (e.g., `1.0.1`).
3. **Tagging**: A new Git tag is created (e.g., `v1.0.1`).
4. **Building**: The workflow builds the source and wheel distributions.
5. **Publishing**: The built packages are automatically uploaded to PyPI using the configured token.
